Search has certainly evolved beyond simple text queries. Currently, Google Lens handles [20 billion visual searches](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/google-lens-ai-overviews-ads-marketers/) every month, whereas more than 50% of all searches are voice-based. Now, 40% of Generation Z uses image search and voice search for shopping, creating fundamental changes in the way content is discovered by users. This multimodal revolution thus calls for a new SEO direction that promotes the parallel optimization of text, voice, images, and video.

This go-to guide will walk you through multimodal SEO and show you how to align your content with Google's AI-powered algorithms to optimize future search behaviors.

## What Is Multimodal SEO?

[Multimodal SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) refers to the optimization of content across all search modalities—text, voice, visual, and video—under the same strategy umbrella. This mode contrasts considerably with traditional SEO, which is limited to queries typed by the user. Essentially, multimodal SEO recognizes that users today search via cameras (Google Lens), voice commands (Siri, Alexa), and even videos (YouTube, TikTok).

Why It Matters in 2025:

- Search Engines Are Multimodal: Google's multi-modal AI now accepts text, images, and video as input and returns results that are rich in contextual meaning
- Shift in User Behavior: 27% of mobile users use voice search regularly, while visual search is growing at 35% every year
- Overview by AI Demand for Full-Fledged Contents: Pages featured in AI overviews tend to include a range of multiple content formats

## Multimodal Search Landscape by 2025

### 1. Visual Search Dominance

Google Lens has matured into serious competition since its launch. With 3 billion users monthly and at least 20% of searches related to shopping, visual search has a significant impact on e-commerce and local discovery.

**Key Visual Search Applications:**

- Identify and price-guess product
- Real-world object recognition (landmark, plant, food)
- Extract text from images (menus, signs, documents)
- Style and fashion ideas

### 2. Voice Search: Now Matured

With 8 billion voice assistants in existence and projected to reach 162.7 million U.S. users by 2027, voice search has gone mainstream.

**Characterization of Voice Search:**

- Conversational queries: Instead of typing keywords, users ask full questions
- Local intent: [58% of the voice searches](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/voice-search-for-local-business-study/) go after local businesses
- Immediate answers: Featured snippets appear 40% of the time as voice results

### 3. Video Search Evolution

YouTube, presently the world's second-largest search engine, is being gradually encroached upon by TikTok as its videos start appearing in Google's main search results.

**Video Search Trends:**

- Multi-platform indexing: Videos appear in Google, on YouTube, and sometimes in social feeds.
- Short-form content prioritization: Shorter, more engaging content gets a better ranking.
- Interactive video elements, such as adding chapters, timestamps, and embedded links, can improve rankings.

## 4 Core Strategies to Succeed in Multimodal SEO

### 1. Optimize Images for Visual Discovery

**Elements of Visual Search SEO:**

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Alt Text     | Descriptive and context-rich (e.g., "red running shoes with white laces on wooden floor") | +40% visual search visibility |
